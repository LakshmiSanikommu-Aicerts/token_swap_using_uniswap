## Phase 1 – Token Readiness (Pre-Launch)

### Contract & Compliance
- Token deployed on Polygon
- Contract verified on Polygonscan
- ERC-20 standard compliance
- No unlimited minting / backdoor controls
- Ownership managed via multisig or timelock

---

## Phase 2 – DEX Listing

### 🔹 Choose DEX (Polygon)
**Primary DEX:**
- QuickSwap (Polygon)

> DEX listing = creating a liquidity pool

---

### 🔹 Liquidity Pair
**Recommended:**
- CERTs / USDC

---

### 🔹 Initial Liquidity (Critical)
**Recommended:**
- 10% of supply → **500,000 CERTs**
- Pair with **$25k–$50k USDC**

---

### 🔹 Liquidity Lock (Trust Layer)
- Lock LP tokens for **12–24 months**

---

### 🔹 DEX Launch Output
After this step:
- CERTs is tradable
- Price is public
- Wallets can buy/sell
- Token appears on DEX tools

## Phase 3 – Token Logo & Branding

### How to Add Logo to Token

#### Step 1: Prepare Logo
- PNG or SVG
- **256×256** (recommended)

## Phase 4 – USD Price Visibility (CoinGecko)

### How CERTs Gets USD Price
- CoinGecko does **not** set price
- Price is auto-calculated from:
  - DEX trades
  - CERTs / USDC pair

Once the CERTs/USDC pool is live:
- USD price exists automatically
- CoinGecko just indexes it
