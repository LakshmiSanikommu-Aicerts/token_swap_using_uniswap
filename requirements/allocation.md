### Allocation Table (Total Supply: 5,000,000 tokens)

| Category                            | Allocation % | Tokens Allocated | Description & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Liquidity Pool**                  | 10.0%        | 500,000          | Initial liquidity on Uniswap (e.g., paired with ETH or stablecoin). Provides immediate trading and reduces early volatility. Consider locking 50–100% of this for 6–12 months via tools like Unicrypt or Team Finance to build community trust. |
| **Team Vesting**                    | 19.3%        | 964,286          | Allocated to founders/core team. Vested linearly over 3–4 years with a 6–12 month cliff (no early release). Prevents dumps and aligns incentives with long-term success.                                                                        |
| **Partners/Advisors Vesting**       | 12.9%        | 642,857          | For strategic partners, early contributors, or advisors. Vested over 2–3 years with cliffs. Ensures continued involvement without flooding the market early.                                                                                    |
| **Marketing/Community/Airdrops**    | 25.7%        | 1,285,714        | For promotions, giveaways, airdrops, influencer campaigns, and user acquisition. Release in phases or based on milestones to support organic growth without causing inflation spikes.                                                           |
| **Token Sinks (Burn/Fees Reserve)** | 12.9%        | 642,857          | Reserved for deflationary mechanics: e.g., 2–5% transaction burn, buyback-and-burn from fees, or permanent burn wallet. Reduces circulating supply over time → potential scarcity & value support.                                              |
| **Ecosystem/Utility Fund**          | 12.9%        | 642,857          | For enforcing utility: staking rewards, governance treasury, DAO proposals, integrations (e.g., NFT minting, game rewards, dApp usage). Locked and released via multisig or smart contract milestones.                                          |
| **Reserves/Contingency**            | 6.4%         | 321,429          | Buffer for unexpected needs, legal, audits, or future opportunities. Often burned if unused after a set period to benefit holders.                                                                                                              |

**Total**: 100.0% → **5,000,000 tokens** (exact match after rounding)

### Quick Observations & Recommendations

- **Liquidity at 10%** is on the lower side for many new tokens (especially memecoins or high-risk projects). It can work if:
  - You expect strong organic demand quickly.
  - You pair with a deep asset (e.g., ETH or USDC on a liquid chain).
  - You lock most of it to signal no rug-pull.
    Many projects start with 15–30% liquidity → consider if you can increase to 15% (750k tokens) later via community raises or treasury.
- **Marketing at ~26%** is healthy — gives you good runway for visibility.
- **Team + Partners ~32%** vested is reasonable but still significant — make sure vesting is transparent and on-chain (e.g., using OpenZeppelin VestingWallet or Sablier).
- **Deflationary reserve (~13%)** + utility fund (~13%) gives solid mechanisms for long-term value accrual.
